# Full Stack Development For Startups: MERN

Open Innovation workshop conducted by Etisalat Digital and The Assembly

Technology startups need to move fast when developing their first MVP and find the right skills and technology stack to get to market quickly. Many agile startups are thus turning to the MERN stack - an open-source, full-stack JavaScript framework for building websites and apps that employs MongoDB, Express, React JS and Node.js to cover end-to-end needs for database, server- and client-side functionality. The popular stack offers quick iterativity and scalability.

In this session, we’ll outline the benefits of MERN for your startup & show you how to get started with the stack by deploying a simple database-driven web project for performing CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations - setting up routes, controllers and models - with a React-based UI, as well as a Node.js web server. We’ll also touch upon how you can incorporate e-commerce into the mix by using payment tools like Stripe.

PREREQUISITES
- Basic coding knowledge & experience
- Web design/development fundamentals - HTML, CSS, JavaScript

WHO IS IT FOR
- Technical founders
- Coding professionals looking to broaden their skills beyond client/server-side restrictions
